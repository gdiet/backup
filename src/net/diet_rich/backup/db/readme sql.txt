PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE or FOREIGN key constraints [... create] an index automatically.

From http://hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/guide.pdf
A PRIMARY KEY constraint is equivalent to a UNIQUE constraint on one or more NOT NULL
columns. Only one PRIMARY KEY can be defined in each table.

JOIN is the short form for INNER JOIN.
