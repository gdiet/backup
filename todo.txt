Should be fixed:

SwingConsole: 30s-messages also to swing console
SwingConsole: 30s-messages to sysout
FTP server better messages
Restore: better messages


TODO:

FTP server choose port and credentials
Backup configurable MatchCheck
SwingConsole controlled exit on close
Progress: start timer when progress starts
Backup: configure threads at runtime
Fix restore so it respects the size in DataInfoDB, not in ByteStoreDB
using() for repository, for progress logging in separate threads, and so on
ctrl-c shutdown hook everywhere
collect errors and warnings everywhere
mailsplit
zip split
memory configuration
restore multithreaded
build
ftp server subproject
it should be possible to restore the tree root
rename "filesystem" to "database" or ...
Tabbed backup/restore file browser like Total Commander
Restore: target file checks
Restore: NPE at target.getParentFile().mkdirs()
